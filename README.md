# D3HashTool by ooCONTAGIONoo

Summary:

This tool allows you to hash a list of Diablo 3 item strings to either Int or Uint value. The format needed to correctly hash a string 
and get the GBID is as followed:

item_string_that_needs_to_be_hashed
name of item that is being hashed

This tool will hash the top name and append the second name to a list that reads:

0000000	=	Item name

Directions:

Select a file that has an item string and an item name. The file must be formatted as shown above, or it will not hash correctly.

Select the value you would like to hash the string to. (If unsure, select Int as default)

Select the Hash button to hash the strings and export them to a text file.

The new text file will be located in the D3_GBIDS folder.
